# Summary

Modeling and simulation in many scientific domains relies on applications that
often do not have a formal application programming interface (API). Instead,
executing an application requires first writing a text-based input file, the
format of which is typically defined in a user's manual. While text-based input
files are suitable for simple one-off calculations, they can become cumbersome
if a user wants to execute the application multiple times and systematically
vary input parameters. In this case, they must resort to either manually making
changes in the input file or developing their own script that modifies the input
file and executes the application. Depending on the format of the input file,
writing such a script can be a non-trivial and error-prone task.

``watts`` (Workflow and Template Toolkit for Simulation) is a Python package
that consists of a set of classes that can manage the execution of one or more
applications. Most importantly, it provides an ability to use placeholder values
in text-based input files that are filled in programmatically from Python,
thereby giving users of scientific applications a means of performing parameter
and sensitivity studies, optimization, and other scientific workflows using
common third-party Python packages. ``watts`` relies on the Jinja [@jinja]
templating engine for handling templated variables and expressions in input
files. In a Jinja template, an identifier surrounded by a pair of ``{{`` and
``}}`` braces denotes a variable; the variable can then be specified using the
``Parameters`` class from ``watts``. When an application is executed via
``watts``, it will first _render_ the template using the specified parameters.

One of the challenges of managing scientific computing workflows that involve
multiple applications is dealing with differing unit systems. Some applications
may use the [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)
system of units whereas others may use some variant of the
[CGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units)
system or even [imperial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units) units.
When a single parameter is used by multiple applications, it begs the question
of what units should be used when specifying the parameter. ``watts`` solves
this problem by optionally storing physical quantities using the ``Quantity``
class from Astropy [@astropy:2013; @astropy:2018], which enables the user to
specify a value along with its associated units. Each application that is linked
to ``watts`` has a unit system specified so that when a templated input file for
that application is rendered, any parameters stored as ``Quantity`` instances
are first converted to the appropriate units. For example, if an application
uses SI units and a parameter is stored in inches, it will first be converted to
meters.

In addition to the templating capabilities provided by ``watts``, there are a
number of other useful capabilities for scientific simulation workflows. Each
time an application is executed through ``watts``, an isolated execution
environment is used so that input and output files are not overwritten from
multiple invocations. Additionally, ``watts`` keeps a local database of
simulation inputs and outputs along with the parameters that are associated with
them for later retrieval.

# Statement of need

The motivation for the development of ``watts`` originated from research and
development activities in nuclear science and engineering (NSE), which rely on a
wide array of applications. Many of these applications have been developed over
decades, and although some---particularly those written in C++ and Python---have
a formal API by which external software can interface with, most legacy software
packages in NSE typically rely on simple text-based input files and do not have
an API. Thus, ``watts`` is meant to aid scientists and engineers in working with
these applications and enable integration with other off-the-shelf and open
source software packages.

There have been prior efforts to develop software that enables parameterization
of input files. In particular, the Funz package [@funz] allows input files to be
templated in a similar manner to ``watts``. However, it differs in several key
respects. First, Funz appears to have a broader scope in terms of how
applications are executed; it allows simulations to be performed from a
command-line interface, Excel, R, Python, bash, Java, and others. ``watts``, on
the other hand, solely focuses on enabling Python-based parameterized workflows.
Another key difference is that Funz defines its own syntax for template
parameters and expressions. In contrast, ``watts`` relies on the Jinja
templating engine and its associated syntax. We believe this is advantageous for
a number of reasons. Relying on Jinja significantly simplifies the
implementation in ``watts`` by delegating all the logic associated with template
rendering. It is also beneficial to users because learning Jinja and its
associated syntax gives them a transferrable skill that is useful in any other
context where Jinja is used (e.g., web development). Finally, Funz does not
provide any functionality for handling unit conversions whereas ``watts`` does.

``watts`` provides a set of "plugin" classes for specific simulation
applications. These plugin classes define how the application is executed
(location of executable and command-line arguments, if any), what input files
are necessary, the system of units to use, and what output files are produced
and collected at the end of a simulation. At present, the collection of plugin
classes consists of common applications used in NSE, including MOOSE [@moose],
SAS [@sas], OpenMC [@openmc; @openmc_zenodo], MCNP [@mcnp], Serpent [@serpent],
RELAP5 [@relap5], Dakota [@dakota], and PyARC [@pyarc]. However, the core
capabilities of ``watts`` are not specific to NSE applications and could be
applied to any science or engineering application.

At Argonne National Laboratory, ``watts`` is currently being used in a variety
of research projects focused on nuclear reactor design that rely on the
aforementioned set of applications. Ongoing work at Argonne also seeks to tie
traditional nuclear reactor design tools with techno-economic and energy market
modeling applications.
